# pumpsOS
I am attempting at creating my own OS. This came to me from a dream that my cat was a programmer and made her own OS. This is my pure attempt at recreating her work

## Goal 
I am learning OS fundamentals. PumpsOS was too mainstream to make in one day but rome wasn't built in one day

## Steps
1. Repo
2. Tooling
3. Minimal Kernal
4. Simple Boot
5. Interupts, timer, scheduler (Thank you Andrew Scott)
6. File system and shell (Getting there0

final - It was literally windows but pumps based and straight out of the 90s

## How this is going to work

- Gonna use small commit names and branches (I hate trees)
- docs/ showcase stuff
